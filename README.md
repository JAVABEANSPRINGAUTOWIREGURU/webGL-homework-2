super cool 10/10 solar system sculpture (ok, maybe 3/10 in retrospect)



The sculpture can be transformed like the shapes from the previous lab:

scaling:

	'x': decrease the width of the shape by a factor of 0.9
	'X': increase the width of the shape by a factor of 1.1
	'y': decrease the height of the shape by a factor of 0.9
	'Y': increase the height of the shape by a factor of 1.1
	'z': decrease the depth of the shape by a factor of 0.9
	'Z': increase the depth of the shape by a factor of 1.1

rotation:

	"w": rotate the current shape clockwise about the x-axis
	"s": rotate the current shape counterclockwise about the x-axis
	"e": rotate the current shape clockwise about the y-axis 
	"q": rotate the current shape counterclockwise about the y-axis
	"d": rotate the current shape clockwise about the z-axis
	"a": rotate the current shape counterclockwise about the z-axis

movement:

	    use arrow keys to move the selected shape
	"," (comma): move the shape forward
	"." (period): move the shape backward
